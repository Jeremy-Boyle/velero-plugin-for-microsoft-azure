## All changes

- Add section to README describing least required privileges in Azure (#75, @justbert)
- Add support for the new `credentialsFile` config key which enables per-BSL credentials. If set, the plugin will use this path as the credentials file for authentication rather than the credentials file path in the environment (#90, @zubron)
