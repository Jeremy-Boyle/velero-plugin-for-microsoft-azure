## All changes

- When service principal or managed identity is used the plugin has the option to access the blob storage directly without fetching a storage access key. This feature is enabled if resourceGroup or subscriptionId isn't set.
  Requirements to enable direct access:
  - subscriptionId and resourceGroup needs to be removed from backup-location-config.
  - The identity accessing the storage account additionally needs the role "Storage Blob Data Contributor", else you will get this error in the velero log: `AuthorizationPermissionMismatch`.

  Using direct access is recommended as it will be the default in a future release. (#111, @yvespp)
- Switch to the Azure SDK for go (#111, @yvespp)
